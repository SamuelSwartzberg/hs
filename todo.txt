  - add/rename missing m3us
  - history
    - move images to hydrus
      - date string parsing
      - eliminate binres images
      - js to rewrite filenames on e.g. g.e-hentai to whatever I choose for hydrus
      - need to think on how to handle other file transmission & parsing (e.g. downloads, images from phone)
      - parse manga panels -> add to hydrus
    - shrinking, moving other documents
    - consider how to integrate email into history
    - is self-renaming of dated dirs implemented?
  - window switcher is limited to spaces, can't deal with minimized items
  - process bookmarks to sessions, urls
  - old contact importing
  - newsboat formatting, interface
  - test:
    - calendar interfacing
    - ics files
    - ics urls
  - health check for MAUDIOVISUAL urls, to find decayed urls and to replace them
  - sub, MAUDIOVISUAL syncing to phone (newpipe, antennapod)
  - repo, file in repo to github path (may already be implemented), also in action table

  - citations
    - add citations and test citation usage workflow
    - rename, sort books based on what is needed for citation workflow, and what is desirable
    - enable book sync to phone  
post: 'stuff is implemented'
  - performance
    - optimize checks by using new stringy functions & memoization where necessary
    - fix memory leak
    - more memoization
    - more item cache
  - some shell to lua
    - don't check dependencies on shell start, instead check them regularly and write missing ones to extra file
    - delete git-paths once we're not using it anymore
  - clean up android
