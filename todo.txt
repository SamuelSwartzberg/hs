  - add/rename missing m3us
  - history
    - move images to hydrus
      - date string parsing
      - eliminate binres images
      - js to rewrite filenames on e.g. g.e-hentai to whatever I choose for hydrus
      - need to think on how to handle other file transmission & parsing (e.g. downloads, images from phone)
      - parse manga panels -> add to hydrus
    - shrinking, moving other documents
    - consider how to integrate email into history
    - is self-renaming of dated dirs implemented?
    - import/sync strava

  - https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.application.watcher.html: use to deactivate mullvad when geforce now? wrap application watchers to make it easier to create stuff?
    - maybe make watchers table with function, type, watcher keys such that we can subclass watchers based on type, this would also unlock additional functionality
  - interface with upkg in hs
    - list installed packages for package manager
    - use timers and upkg to autofetch updates? (needs to be thorougly tested though)

    - add citations and test citation usage workflow
