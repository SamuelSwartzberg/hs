    - family health data
  - health check for MAUDIOVISUAL urls, to find decayed urls and to replace them -> Perhaps better\: cache MAUDIOVISUAL urls, allow playing of those local files as dropin (however, we also query a lot from yt, so we need to cache that - ideally permanently). However\: Cache should be conceptualized as temporary, but this cache as permanent. So we need some solution to say 'don't delete this cache', or a different kind of cache.
  - sub, MAUDIOVISUAL syncing to phone (newpipe, antennapod)
  - danbooru search links need their query to count as 'seen' for other queries
